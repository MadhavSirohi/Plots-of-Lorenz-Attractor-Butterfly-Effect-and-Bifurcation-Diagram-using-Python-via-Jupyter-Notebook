# Plots-of-Lorenz-Attractor-Butterfly-Effect-and-Bifurcation-Diagram-using-Python-via-Jupyter-Notebook
This project was done in winters of 2021, I did it for 4 days 3 hours daily.
The plotting here was done for my pre final semester project on Lorenz Attractor: Itroduction to chaos and non linear dynamics(Bifurcation Diagram, logistic map), it done here to understand and study the topic by the means of graphs, detailed documentation for them was done in the report, presentation and files submitted by me.
As of now the code lacks proper commenting for self explanation of it, nevertheless if you are interested in knowing how the code works, the Mathematics of it(ODEs, Finite differences, Partial Derivatives, Derivatives etc), the Physics behind and occuring from it and so on then kindly feel free to contact me at madhavsirohi.2012@gmail.com, I will also include the references I used myself to do this work.
